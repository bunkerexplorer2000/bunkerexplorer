			<h1>Onion Links</h1>
			<h3>Nov 18th, 2021 | 7:52pm</h3>
			<p>I am looking into getting an onion domain. Probably won't happen *anytime soon* because I need more money for hosting on cloud services, and the domain itself. But just think about it: bunkerexplorer on the darkweb! It would be extremely goofy, I think. Bunker explorer, on every surface of the internet!</p>
			<br>
			<p>If you don't know anything about this and would like to learn you can visit my <a href="https://bunkerexplorer.com/pedia.html" target="_blank" style="color:cyan;">pedia</a> where I have talked about TOR, onion routing, and more.</p>

			<h1>Bunkerpedia Founded</h1>
			<h3>Nov 18th, 2021 | 5:29pm</h3>
			<p>For more web design practice I've made BUNKERPEDIA! It is a completely useless page I will be adding to the NAVBAR of this site. Also I've removed the "<a href="assets/images/trollinthehall.png" target="_blank">troll</a>" from the navbar. Also, the Bunkerpedia is sort of like this updates thing, only more random. This is SOMEWHAT random, but I just felt like making a pedia, so I DID.</p>

			<h1>Thesis statement done</h1>
			<h3>Nov 6, 2021 | 7:34pm</h3>
			<p>	Evaluating the statements I’ve been given, Nationalism in the 19th century united people into nation states separate from empires/other nations, resulting in war and the collapse of many empires. This is because the people who were in those empires split from them, uniting to make their own nation. Basically, during this time period people were inspired to break apart from existing empires because of the government and unite with other like minded people to create a new sovereign political nation. Something that inspired people to do this is being prideful in their nation. After looking over the documents, I’ve noticed a very common thing. There are many things that result from nationalism, but it can be summarized into one easy statement. Uniting into separate nation states came with a cost, many empires fell and war broke out among them because of this.</p>

			<p>its about nationalism basically uniting into nation states apart from empires literally ruined the empires lifes and made war happen (sad) (bad) (un goofy)</p>

			<img src="assets/images/nest.png" style="width: 75%;">
			<p>I've added a footer w/ contact information. As well as figured out how to use inline CSS to resize images so they fit without any issues (on my screen, at least). Image attached above to further test it.</p>

			<h3>Nov 3, 2021 | 9:31pm</h3>
			<p>Pasting in boxes is easy but having the ability to post from the website would be easier. I'm not that smart, probably won't happen.</p>
