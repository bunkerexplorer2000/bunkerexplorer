				<h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
				<div class="linediv"></div>
				<p class="message">Get the image of Wikipedia out of your head. Bunkerpedia is not like Wikipedia whatsoever, despite going for a similiar look, Bunkerpedia will not contain the same content. Bunkerpedia will be an index of information, websites, and resources. The reason they will be held here is because I, Bunker, find them useful, and feel the need to contain them in a useful spot for later use. Or just stuff I think about. The definition of the suffix <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-pedia" target="_blank">pedia</a> is "A specialized encyclopedia about the prefix" (Wikipedia). Taking this into context, Bunkerpedia is a specialized encyclopedia on whatever the hell I want so no questions asked about the content within.</p>
				
				<div id="warning", class="content">
					<h2 class="title" style="color: red;">Warning</h2>
					<div class="linediv"></div>
					<p class="message">Most of the content found on this page is meant to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire" target="_blank">satirical</a>. I am creating this as a practice for web development. So, most of the content will be added as I find reasons to add random nonsensical content. Most of the content will be random, not funny or funny.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="mainsite", class="content">
					<h2 class="title">Main Site</h2>
					<div class="linediv"></div>
					<p class="message">The main website can be accessed by selecting the link found in the top right of this page or <a href="https://bunkerexplorer.com" target="_blank">here</a>. The main site was also developed as web development practice. I intially purchased the <a href="https://bunkerexplorer.com/" target="_blank">bunkerexplorer.com</a> domain for fun as it was cheap. I decided to copy and paste a ton of stuff from a YouTube video onto Github and boom I had a website. I might rebuy the domain next year and continue this if it's just as cheap as a passion project/ portfolio.</p>

			<div id="hackeysack", class="content">
				<h1 class="title">Hackey Sack</h1>
				<div class="linediv"></div>
				<p class="message">Hackey sacks are small bags filled with sand or pellets. "Hackey Sacks" got its name in 1970, it was initially kicked into the air as part of a competitive game or a display of dexterity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacky_sack" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>). Me personally, I use my hackey sack as a "toy" that I throw onto the cieling or wall back and forth. Sort of like a "fidget toy" for me, I guess.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="jrotcop", class="content">
				<h1 class="title">JROTC Opinions</h1>
				<div class="linediv"></div>
				<p class="message">I do not like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Reserve_Officers%27_Training_Corps" target="_blank">JROTC</a>. The students within said class are exceptionally missbehaved. My personal run ins with them have been horrible. They behave in such an awful manner. I do not support the JROTC because of this.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="tor", class="content">
				<h1 class="title">TOR</h1>
				<div class="linediv"></div>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/pedia/onionrelay.jpg" style="width: 20%; float: right;"></a>
				<p class="message"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)" target="_blank">TOR</a>, short for "The Onion Router", is a free an open source software for enabling anonymous communication (Wikipedia). It directs your internet traffic through an overlay network. This means a network, that is layered ontop of another network. Like an onion has layers, hence the name Onion Router. It takes your traffic and throws it through numerous TOR relays around the world (there are about six thousand in existance) and then to the website. This makes it much harder (not impossible) to track your your location and usage of websites. While it's not impossible it's extremely hard if the proper saftey precautions are taken. (May have issues; as I am not an expert on the topic)</p>
				

				<div id="darkweb", class="content">
					<h2 class="title">Dark Web</h2>
					<div class="linediv"></div>
					<p class="message">The Dark Web is the content on the internet that can only be accessed via "darknets". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web" target="_blank">Darknet</a> are overlay networks that can only be accessed with specific software (TOR, I2P, etc;)(Wikipedia). Plenty of illegal content and legal content can be found on the dark web. It is simply just a side of the internet that is more anonymous. The reason I add this to Bunkerpedia is in my class we're learning about the Darkweb. Since then, I've installed tails os onto a USB stick and browsed the dark web on TOR.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="tailsos", class="content">
					<h2 class="title">Tails OS</h2>
					<div class="linediv"></div>
					<p class="message">Tails OS is based off of Debian Linux. It was built to protect against surveillance and censorship. It comes with the TOR browser, and various other useful software. It's biggest perk of course, is the fact that it is portable. "<a href="https://tails.boum.org" target="_blank">Tails</a> includes a selection of applications to work on sensitive documents and communicate securely. Everything in Tails is ready-to-use and has safe defaults" (Tails). If you're going to browse the dark web, I would recommend using Tails OS. It works perfectly fine, and is just another layer of security. You can of course use Windows, base Linux, etc; But Tails is all the more secure, and it comes with all the tools necessary and more.</p>
